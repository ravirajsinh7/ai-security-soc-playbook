## 🧠 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping for AI Threats

AI-driven attacks **reuse classic adversary techniques**. The table below maps AI risks to the **MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise framework** for SOC alignment.

| AI Threat | MITRE Tactic | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Prompt Injection | Initial Access, Execution | Manipulating AI inputs to trigger unintended actions |
| AI Phishing & Deepfakes | Initial Access, Credential Access | Social engineering using AI-generated content |
| Shadow AI Usage | Collection, Exfiltration | Sensitive data uploaded to unauthorized AI tools |
| Training Data Poisoning | Defense Evasion, Impact | Corrupting model behavior through poisoned data |
| Model Inversion | Collection, Exfiltration | Extracting sensitive training data |
| Over-Privileged AI Agents | Privilege Escalation, Impact | Excessive permissions abused by AI automation |
| AI Hallucination Errors | Impact | Incorrect AI guidance causing insecure changes |
